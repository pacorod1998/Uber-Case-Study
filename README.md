# Uber Case Study
Data Analysis with Python

DailyUber provides the 2016 data. By using this data find out the demand and supply Analysis gap of the cab. The main objective of this project is to analyse the data on Uber Request data. Through the analysis of data, we can find some important insights.

*  App Openings (Eyeballs) = Customers who launch the app looking for riders. It is a good measure of demand
*   Zeroes = Customers who open the app and see no cars in the area.
*   Request = Customers who make requests for a car.
*   Completed Trip = The point from when a customer is picked


**Objectives for Analysis**

1.   Which date had the most completed trips during the two weeks?
2.   What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24-hour period?
3.   Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two-week period?
4.   What percentages of all zeroes during the two week period occurred on weekends (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)?
5.   What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two week period?
6.   In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8 hour shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two week period in terms of unique requests? A new shift starts every 8 hours. Assume that a driver will work the same shift each day.
7.   True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two week period.
8.   If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two week period, which hour should you add them to?
9.  True or False: There is exactly two weeks of data in this analysis
10.  Looking at the data from all two weeks, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight? (i.e when are supply and demand at both their natural minimums)
